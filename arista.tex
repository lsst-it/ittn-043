\subsection{Closing Comments}

Arista provides hardware with good performance running on a reliable operating system. It is priced competitively and the perpetual license is a welcome feature. 

The support and involvement provided the pre-sales Arista team it is above our expectations and there's interest from the provider to work with Rubin. 

The similarities of the CLI to the Cisco CLI makes it easier for Rubin's engineers to learn and understand the components of the operating system. 

The capability to open a shell session in the underlaying Linux system allows to perform further troubleshooting not available on Cisco devices. All Rubin's engineers are quite proficient in Linux hence accessing its tools in network devices is very appreciated. 

The low amount of CVEs reported proves that the software is of good quality and also implies that emergency patches with potential outages is not a common event.
